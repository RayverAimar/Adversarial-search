The present repository stores a minimax tree algorithm implementation for tic tac toe matches

### Install libraries 

This project make use of tkinter python library for graphic interfaces, so install it if you haven't before.

```
$ pip install tk
```

### Running the project

This project doesn't make use of setups, so in order to see the project just run `main.py` file as normally:

```
$ python .\main.py
```

You'll get to see a window asking for minimax algorithm's depth, according to this parameter the Artificial Intelligence will play smart depending on how high the number of the depth is.

After this you'll be prompted the player with the first movement in the board

And finally you'll need to configure the dimensions of the board you want to play in

Once you configure the environment, depending on who starts, you'll be able to play against the AI
